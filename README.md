# ROCKA TEST

This is a test project for Rocka.
This has been developed in **Reactjs** using **Next** as an interface and published in **Nowjs**. ([See link](https://zeit.co/ivajo26/rocka-test/xmllgbbxcu?redirect=1))

The code is commented as to its functions and is explicit as to the name of its functions.

In this we can see a list of genres, actors and imbd in the header and selecting these we can select to filter, in this way a new list is generated. Using the lower buttons we can go back or forward the movie in the list.
